<Step>
<StepItem title="Requirements">

Make sure you have the following installed:

-   **Python 3.10+**
-   **uv**

Check your versions:

```bash
python --version
uv --version
```

If `uv` is not installed:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Or using the official installer:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

For comprehensive installation options (Windows, Homebrew, etc.), refer to the [official uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Install Volt">

Choose one of the following methods to install Volt:

### Shell Installer (Recommended)

Volt provides a simple shell installer that downloads and installs the latest version automatically.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VishwaKumaran/volt/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs Volt globally and makes the `volt` command available in your `PATH`.

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

You can install Volt using Homebrew via the official tap:

```bash
brew tap VishwaKumaran/volt
brew install volt
```

### Using uv

```bash
uv tool install volt-cli
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install volt-cli
```

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Verify Installation">

Verify that Volt is correctly installed and available in your path:

```bash
volt --help
```

You should see the list of available commands.

## Upgrade Volt

If you already have Volt installed, upgrade to the latest version.

### With uv

```bash
uv tool upgrade volt-cli
```

### With pip

```bash
pip install --upgrade volt-cli
```

## Uninstall Volt

Remove the tool if needed:

```bash
uv tool uninstall volt-cli
```

or

```bash
pip uninstall volt-cli
```
