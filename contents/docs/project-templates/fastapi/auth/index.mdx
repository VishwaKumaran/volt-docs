title: Authentication
description: Adding authentication to your Volt project.
---

Authentication is a critical part of most applications. Volt can scaffold a robust authentication system for you.

## Features (Optional)

You can add auth features using `volt add auth`. This includes:

-   **User Models**: Database tables for users.
-   **Password Hashing**: Secure hashing with bcrypt or Argon2.
-   **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
-   **OAuth2**: Login flows (e.g., "Login with Google") compatible with FastAPI security utilities.

## Usage

Simply run:

```bash
volt add auth
```

This will inject the necessary models, schemas, and API routes (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`) into your project.
