These are the common environment variables used in a Volt-generated project.

## Core

-   `APP_ENV`: The environment the app is running in (`development`, `production`, `testing`).
-   `SECRET_KEY`: A long, random string used for cryptographic signing.
-   `DEBUG`: `True` or `False`. Should be `False` in production.

## Database

-   `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for the database.
    -   Example: `postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost/dbname`

## CORS

-   `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed origins.
    -   Example: `http://localhost:3000,https://myapp.com`
