description: How to configure your Volt project and environment.
---

Volt projects are designed to be 12-factor app compliant, meaning all configuration is stored in the environment.

## Key Configuration Files

-   **`.env`**: Local environment variables (secrets, DB credentials).
-   **`pyproject.toml`**: Project metadata, dependencies, and tool settings (Ruff, Pytest).
-   **`volt.toml`**: (Optional) Volt-specific template settings if you need to override defaults.
