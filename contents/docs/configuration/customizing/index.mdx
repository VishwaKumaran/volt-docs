description: How to customize the code generated by Volt.
---

Since Volt generates standard Python code, there is no magic "Volt framework" locking you in. You can customize your project just like any other Python application.

## Modifying Dependencies

Add new packages using `uv`:

```bash
uv add requests
```

This will verify compatibility and update `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

## Ejecting

There is no "eject" command because you are never "inside" Volt. Once the project is generated, it is yours. You can delete any Volt-related config files if you wish and continue maintenance manually.
